# Privacy Policy – Tillify by Cyber Arcenal

**Effective Date:** March 1, 2026  

## Information Collection  
This application does not collect personal information without user consent. All sales, inventory, and loyalty data are stored locally on the user’s device. Optional features such as email or SMS notifications may require the user to provide contact details, which are used solely for delivering alerts.  

## Information Usage  
Data processed within the app is used exclusively for point‑of‑sale operations, inventory tracking, and customer loyalty management. Optional integrations (e.g., notifications) are configured by the user and are not enabled by default.  

## Information Sharing  
We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties. Data may only be transmitted to external services explicitly chosen by the user (e.g., email or SMS providers).  

## Security  
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect stored data against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. Since data is primarily stored locally, users are responsible for securing their own devices.  

## User Control  
Users may clear or reset all stored data at any time by uninstalling the application or using the built‑in reset option. No residual data is retained once the app is removed from the device.  

## Children’s Privacy  
This application is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.  

## Changes to This Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on the official listing.
